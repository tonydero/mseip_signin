Initial command-line app created for MSEIP peer mentors to use to log students in for office hours, etc. and to view in which core courses the student is enrolled.


Goal:
- Ask for ID
- log arrival time
- Search db for ID
- If the ID is in the db, pull list of core courses the student is taking and display them
- If not, display data use agreement and ask followup questions
- Ask for which core courses the student is taking. (would be an array of check boxes eventually)
- Ask why student is there.
- Save responses and times
