Initial command-line app created for MSEIP peer mentors to use to log students in for office hours, etc. and to view in which core courses the student is enrolled.


Goal:
- Ask for ID
- Search db for ID
- If the ID is in the db, retrieve response to the data use agreement (DUA)
- If not, display DUA and ask followup questions
- Ask for which courses the student is there to get help
- Ask for what the student is there for help
- Save responses (if applicable) and log time
- Log time of exit on next swipe
- Log everyone out, if still logged in, when shut down
